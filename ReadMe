Battleship 

Fairly wonky AI, and sort of works...could use improvemeent, but it doesn't cheat.

Run through Visual Studio. Running it might lag for a bit to load the form data because it is not used for it's intended purposes.

Start -> Player places ships and then the health is tracked -> the score is visualized by the HP of each ship added. 

Good Luck!
